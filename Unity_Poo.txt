Unity AA Plan of Operations
Adopted via Group Conscience, 6 December 2017
Overview

The plan represents the shared experience of AA members and groups throughout the area. It also reflects guidance given through the Twelve Traditions and the General Service Conference. In keeping with our Tradition of autonomy, except in matters affecting other groups or AA as a whole, most decisions are made by the group conscience of the members involved.

Purpose

Meeting Leader Liaison
The Meeting Leader Liaison ensures the scheduled meetings held by Unity AA have leaders, and that the meeting leaders utilize the recommended formats and literature for their meetings. The Meeting Leader Liaison will function as the primary contact person and guide for the meeting leaders. Each Meeting Leader will agree to serve as Meeting Leader for a period of three months. A Meeting Leader will also have obtained three months of continuous sobriety.

The Literature Chairperson makes certain AA Conference-approved books and pamphlets, ordered from the General Service Office or purchased from the local intergroup (Central Office), are on hand for meetings and properly displayed. Considers suggestions regarding proposed additions to and changes in Conference-approved literature and audiovisual material. Encourages AA members to read and purchase AA Conference-approved literature through the group or Central Office.

Treatment and Corrections Representative
The Treatment and Corrections Representative ensures related meetings have meeting leaders and that all issues surrounding details of coordination of meetings are covered. AAs work together, as far as possible, by using suggestions from those who have already had experience carrying the message into treatment facilities.

Central Office Delegate
The Central Office Delegate participates in Central Office business meetings to share the group’s experience in carrying the message. The Central Office Delegate also keeps the group well informed about what Central Office is doing.

Grapevine and Accessibility Representative
The Grapevine and Accessibility Representative explores, develops, and offers resources to make the AA message and participation in our program available to everyone who reaches out for it. The goal is to make AA as accessible as possible to all. The Accessibility Representative coordinates with Central Office to make AA material available. The Grapevine Representative makes subscription blanks for the publication readily available to the group, maintains the group’s Grapevine subscription and library, and encourages the use of the Grapevine in meetings.

Webmaster
The Webmaster will maintain records online.

Attendance at all required meetings is necessary to ensure the Steering Committee member is providing adequate information to the Committee and to the Group as a whole. Because attendance is so important, should a Steering Committee member miss two consecutive meetings without obtaining a substitute to attend the meeting and make the appropriate report, that Steering Committee member will be replaced. The Secretary will draft an announcement to be made at all Unity meetings and an election will be held to fill the position at the next regularly scheduled Steering Committee meeting as is practical. Participation by all members is encouraged in order to assure infusion of new and Trusted Servants, energy & ideas; and to help make such service a joyful experience rather than a burdensome responsibility.
